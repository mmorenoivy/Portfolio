    <p>Hi, I am Marj. By the time you have reached this page, I know you have been reading the same old "Hi, I am so and so and I am a [insert job]!".
    I wanted to be different so I thought about this thoroughly.</p>
    <p>I have been in the Tech Industry for 9 years. My titles were Software Quality Assurance, IT Analyst, Senior Software Quality Analyst,
    Quality Analyst and Software Quality Engineer.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student in freeCodeCamp's Software Engineering program. So you'd ask me, why software engineering when you are a Software QA?
    Yes, I test and look for something that is already broken in the software. My job is more than clicking links, but coming up with crazy different possible user scenarios is another thing.
    I have loved programming since I was in High School, then I took Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>How did I ended up as QA? There's not a lot of companies in our area accepts newbie programmers. I am in the QA but I learned most programming stuff in the QA side with the help of my senior developer teammates.</p>
    <p>I have acquired skills such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, C#, XML/XSLT, JSON, Java, MS SQL, MySQL and a bit of Python - with Flask.
    The tools I know how to use are Visual Studio, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Atlassian's JIRA, Mantis, IBM Rational Quality Center, HP Quality Control, Trello.
    The testing tools I use as a QA is Selenium Webdriver, HP Loadrunner, IBM Rational Performance Tester, IBM Rational Functional Tester and Oracle Application Testing Suite.</p>
    <p>I moved to Jonesboro, Arkansas United States and been living here for about 3 years. I finished my degree in Computer Science at Data Center College of the Philippines in the little city called Baguio, Philippines.
    Ever since I moved to the US, my passion for development got stronger when my teammates encouraged me to code. It helped me a lot to achieve my productivity at work.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not in front of my computer, I travel. I have travelled most of Asia and some parts of Americas. I travel a lot with my husband and my 21 month old boy.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
